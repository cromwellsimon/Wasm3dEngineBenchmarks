# WASM 3D Engine Benchmarks
Wanted to test out the performance in WebGL for Unity, Godot, and Evergine. Bevy and Fyrox are two other engines that I could/should test as well. Outside of those five, I don't know of any other engines that would qualify yet since Unreal removed WebGL support and most other .NET game engines are waiting for changes in .NET 9 to add support.
